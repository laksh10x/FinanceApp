## **Overview**
**FinanceApp** leverages machine learning techniques to predict future stock prices. The application uses historical stock data, cleans and processes it using **Pandas** and **NumPy**, and then applies predictive models like **Linear Regression** and **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) for stock price forecasting. The results are visualized using **Matplotlib** and served through a user-friendly web interface built with **Django** and **REST APIs**.

## **Features**
- **Stock Price Prediction:** Predict future stock prices using **Linear Regression** and **LSTM** models.
- **Data Processing:** Clean and process financial data using **Pandas** and **NumPy** for enhanced model accuracy.
- **Visualization:** Real-time prediction visualization with **Matplotlib** for better data insights.
- **Responsive Web App:** Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Django**, making it user-friendly and responsive.
- **RESTful API:** Backend services exposed via **REST API** for real-time stock data retrieval and prediction.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Machine Learning:** Linear Regression, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- **Web Development:** Django, REST APIs, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Data Processing & Visualization:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## **Installation**

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)
- Virtualenv (optional, but recommended)

## **Usage**

### **Predict Stock Prices**
- Enter the stock ticker (e.g., **AAPL** for Apple) in the input field to predict the stock prices.
- The app will fetch historical data, process it, and display the predicted future prices.

### **Visualization**
- The app generates visual graphs that represent stock data, predictions, and trends over time, providing clear insights into the stockâ€™s performance.
